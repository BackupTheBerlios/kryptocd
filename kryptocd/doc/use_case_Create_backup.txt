Select files and directories to backup,

The user may choose files and full directories with a file selection dialog.
Then he also chooses the backup method (We have two different backup methods,
see Backup_method.txt). The user can save this selection of files and
directories as a backup profile.

Alternatively, the user can choose from previously generated backup profiles.
The user will then also select a backup level.
The computer will find all files and directories that have to go into this
Backup then by itself.

The user has to type in the passphrase to be used to encrypt the backup
with a symmetrical cypher (gpg -c). The CD capacity can either be detected 
automatically or typed in by the user.

Backups will automatically span over several cd's in case the data does not
fit on one cd. If, by the time when enough data is collected to start the cd
writing process, a writable cd with enough capacity is detected in the cd
writing device, then the cd writing is performed without requiring the user
to sit next to the computer just to perform a mouse-click.

Even if there was no suitable cd in the cd writing device at the time
krypptocd first checked when a new image was ready, so that it asks the user
to insert a writable cd, the newly inserted cd is detected and used for
the next image even if the user does not press a key or mouse button
(thus not requiring him to switch on the screen for just one mouse click).
This requires periodic checks of the cd writing device.
