KryptoCD provides two different methods for creating backups

1st Method: Tarfile method
--------------------------
As many files as possible are put in a tar archiv, which is then compressed
with bzip2 and encrypted with gpg -c. This method makes efficient use of the
space available on the cds, and it is easy to restore the whole archive or
selected files with command line tools.

However this method is very sensitive to disk errors -- just one bad block
(even one bad bit) on the cd will render all data stored after this block
completely useless.  

So, if you use this method, be sure to make full backups pretty often, and
do not rely too much on incremental backups.

2nd Method: Indexfile method
----------------------------
Each file going into the backup will be stored in a tar archiv of its own,
which will then be compressed and encrypted as above. All of these
single-file-archivs will be stored flat in the root directory of the cd,
the file names will be index numbers, and there will be an encrypted index
file which translates index numbers to filesystem names.
Directories will be stored together in one single file which shows up on
every disk of a multiple disk archive.


----


Both methods should probably provide index files so that the user easily
knows which files are present on a backup, and on which disk.
